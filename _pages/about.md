I am preparing for a doctoral study starting in 2024 fall. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in June 2023. I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) on machine-learning-based design space exploration for cyber-physical systems complying with Time-Sensitive Networking, [Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) on improving energy-accuracy trade-off for deep learning inference using Near/In-Memory Computing, and [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) on neural network circuit synthesis.
