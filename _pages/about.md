I am applying for graduate programs starting in the fall term of 2024. I received my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in June 2023. I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) on design space exploration for cyber-physical systems complying with Time-Sensitive Networking, [Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) on energy-efficient policies for deep learning inference using Near/In-Memory Computing, and [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) on neural network synthesis.
