I am pursuing a Ph.D. at MIT EECS starting in 09/2024. I received my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from the National Taiwan University in June 2023. I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) on deep-learning-based design space exploration for cyber-physical systems complying with Time-Sensitive Networking, [Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) on energy-accuracy optimization for deep learning inference using Near/In-Memory-Computing-based accelerators, and [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) on quantized neural network circuit synthesis.
